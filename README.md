### Overview
The analysis looked into how the Earth's temperature has changed from 1961 to 2022 and guessed what might happen with temperatures from 2023 to 2032. It aimed to show how much the Earth's temperature is going up, find out which places are getting warmer the fastest, and predict how temperatures might keep changing. The study showed that the Earth is getting warmer quickly, and some countries are feeling the heat more than others. It highlighted the need to do something about this warming trend.

### Tools Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: A Python library utilized for data manipulation and analysis, enabling the handling of large data sets and complex computations with ease.
- **NumPy**: Employed for numerical operations, especially useful in handling arrays and mathematical functions across the data.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Python libraries used for data visualization, enabling the creation of a wide range of static, interactive, and animated plots and charts to effectively communicate the findings.

### Analysis Done
1. **Global Temperature Change Trend Analysis**: Calculated the average annual temperature changes globally from 1961 to 2022, revealing a clear upward trend indicative of climate change acceleration.
2. **Predictive Modelling**: Employed linear regression to forecast global temperature changes from 2023 to 2032, predicting continued significant increases.
3. **Geographical Analysis**: Identified countries with the highest average temperature changes, highlighting regions most vulnerable to climate change impacts.
4. **Statistical and Correlation Analysis**: Conducted a correlation analysis between years and temperature changes, demonstrating a strong, statistically significant positive correlation.
5. **Anomaly Detection**: Detected significant anomalies within the data, notably identifying 2020 as a year with exceptionally high temperature changes.
6. **Data Visualization**: Created visual representations of the analysis, including trends over time, future predictions, and geographical disparities in climate change impacts, providing clear and accessible insights into the data.
